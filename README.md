# Just how Trashy are you?

Every year, the City of Philadelphia disposes **1 ton** of waste *per
resident.* That is ... *impressive.*  The city has also made it a goal to
[eliminate litter and landfill use](https://cleanphl.org/programs/zerowaste/)
by 2035.

**What about us?**

How much trash do we generate?  What's normal?  **What's possible?**  I want to
find out so that we can finally *throw away* the name *"Filthadelphia."*

I built a simple web-app to let you keep track of your estimated landfill use.
Can you help out by tracking how much trash you take out for the next 6 - 12
weeks?

Please get started on the [live
site](http://django.pablovirgo.com), and keep track for the next few weeks.
That will give me an idea of how much trash a typical household generates, and
provide a starting point to understand how we can help make Philadelphia on of
the *least* trash cities in history.
