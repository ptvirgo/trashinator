# Make less trash!

Every year, the City of Philadelphia disposes **1 ton** of waste *per
resident.* That is ... *impressive.*  The city has *also* made it a goal to
[eliminate litter and landfill use](https://cleanphl.org/programs/zerowaste/)
by 2035.

**What about us?**

How much trash do we generate?  What's normal?  **What's possible?**  I want to
find out so that we can finally *throw away* the name *"Filthadelphia."*

This is a simple web-app to let you keep track of your estimated landfill use.

Right now it would be especially helpful to have:

- Beta testers & early adopters (just [jump on](https://django.pablovirgo.com/trash/) if you want to help!)
- Feedback if there are desired features
- Help with visual design
- Tips or thoughts from behavior scientists, data scientists, and fellow engineers
